- description: "Griffon is a sophisticated tool believed to be in use by one of more\
    \ \"APT\" groups.  This atomic is for detecting, specifically, the reconnaissance\
    \ part of the tool.\nThis script used here was reduced by security researcher\
    \ Kirk Sayre (github.com/kirk-sayre-work/1a9476e7708ed650508f9fb5adfbad9d), \n\
    and it gives the exact same recon behavior as the original (minus the C2 interaction).\
