- description: 'Invokes the command line similar to that used by Ryuk Ransomware to
    grant full access to the entire C:\ drive for Everyone.

    **icacls "C:\*" /grant Everyone:F /T /C /Q**

    However, for this atomic we set the permission on C:\Users\Public so it completes
    faster and doesn''t irreversibly affect the host.

    You can set your own path variable to "C:\*" if you prefer.
