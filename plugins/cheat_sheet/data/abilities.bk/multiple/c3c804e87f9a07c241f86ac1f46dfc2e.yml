- description: 'This module injects shellcode into a newly created process and executes.
    By default the shellcode is created,

    with Metasploit, for use on x86-64 Windows 10 machines.


    Note: Due to the way the VBA code handles memory/pointers/injection, a 64bit installation
    of Microsoft Office

    is required.
