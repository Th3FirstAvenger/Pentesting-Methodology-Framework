- description: 'This module attempts to emulate malware authors utilizing well known
    techniques to extract data from memory/binary files. To do this

    we first create a string in memory then pull out the pointer to that string. Finally,
    it uses this pointer to copy the contents of that

    memory location to a file stored in the $env:TEMP\atomic_t1059_005_test_output.bin.
