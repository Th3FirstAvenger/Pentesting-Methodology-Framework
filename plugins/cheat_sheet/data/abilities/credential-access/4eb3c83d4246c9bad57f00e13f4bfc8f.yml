- description: 'Look for the encrypted cpassword value within Group Policy Preference
    files on the Domain Controller.

    This test is intended to be run from a domain joined workstation, not on the Domain
    Controller itself.

    The Get-GPPPasswords.ps1 executed during this test can be obtained using the get-prereq_commands.


    Successful test execution will either display the credentials found in the GPP
    files or indicate "No preference files found".
